Upgrading from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0
===============================

- From version 1.3.0, the dependency from KnpPaginatorBundle is optional. So, if you do not require that bundle, you
  can remove all references from your project. If you customized controller or template, please check the differences
  in User module.
